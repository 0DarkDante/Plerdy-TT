          Thanks to the data gathered with the Plerdy heatmap about your website visitors’ behavior, you can generate hypotheses that potentially explain which functional flaws and problems are causing a low conversion on your website and how.

          Some services disregard such an important aspect as the clickability analysis of the dynamic elements when UX auditing, including drop-down menu, pop-up, and slider. However, thanks to the unique Plerdy auditing functionality, you will receive this information.

        <p>
          In some areas, websites generate more than 60% of the traffic from their mobile versions, so it would be unwise not to audit the behavior of mobile users. With the Plerdy heatmap, you can run a UX auditing analysis separately for the desktop and mobile versions of your website.
